Simulation code (frb.ipynb)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This worksheet simulates scintillation in the IGM/ISM as well as gravitational
lensing by ray-tracing the signal from the source to the observer across an
arbitrary number of scintillation screens (limited by available memory and CPU
power).

Examples for how to use it are given in section "Results".

Further information is given in the first section of the worksheet
